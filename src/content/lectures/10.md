title: Documenting Systems Pt 2
date: November 13th, 2023
description: Software systems are very complex, for this reason, it is important to serialize our thoughts and ideas formally into documentation. We will do this through the creation of two types of documents, architecture documents, and technical specifications. This lecture will discuss how to use these documents to define a system, covering topics like conceptualizing architectural components, specifying testing strategies, and constructing the structure of the software system.
