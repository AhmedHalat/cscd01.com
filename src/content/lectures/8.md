title: Analyzing an Architecture
date: 2023-10-30
description: Architecture is about decision-making. Every decision carries with it an element of risk, some probability that an issue will occur. Identifying architectural risk early is a key part of project success. Doing so allows the project team to mitigate these risks ahead of time before things go wrong. This lecture will talk about how to identify risks in an existing system and some potential mitigation strategies.
